# Text-Based RPG Game

Developer notes: I am a big fan of programming, Star Wars and MUD's. Eager to learn Python,
I thought it would be an awesome project to develop a game, taking all my interests as the inspiration.
What I ended up with was a fantasy world, far far away in a Galaxy no one has ever heard from...BLACK STAR...

Feel free to reach out to me if you like the game/concept or if you have any ideas on what I can improve.

Some notes about the Game:

--Controls--

"l" or "look" = view room
