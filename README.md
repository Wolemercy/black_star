# BLACK STAR
**A Text-Based RPG**


### **Developer Notes**

I am a big fan of programming, Star Wars and RPG's. Eager to learn Python,
I thought it would be an awesome project to develop a game, taking all my interests as the inspiration.
What I ended up with was a sci-fi world, far far away in a Galaxy no one has ever heard from.

Welcome to ...BLACK STAR...

Feel free to reach out to me if you like the game and concept or if you have any ideas on what I can improve or even if you just want to say hi :-)


### **About**

Black Star is a sci-fi RPG, which takes place in a galaxy which is unknown and has never been explored, namely Black Star. A young protagnist, the player, wakes up on board a star cruiser in a holding cell, with no recollection of how he/she got there or even what his/her name is. With no memory the player explores the star cruiser in the hope to discover his/her identity and to find out how they ended up on this ship in the first place. Hold on tight for the adventure of a lifetime as you explore and survive the vast galaxy that is Black Star!


### **Controls**

- 'view(v)' to look around in this area
- 'map(m)' to look at the map of the world
- 'inspect(y)' to view item attributes
- 'take(t)' to take item into inventory
- 'status(s)' to view current player status, attributes and equipped gear
- 'inventory(i)' to view current player's inventory
- 'up(u)', 'down(d)', 'left(l)' and 'right(r)' to move around between areas
- 'clear(c)' to clear the terminal
- 'quit(q)' to quit the game
