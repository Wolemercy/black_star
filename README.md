# Text-Based MUD Game

Developer notes:
I am a big fan of programming, Star Wars and MUD's. Eager to learn Python,
I thought it would be an awesome project to develop a game, taking all my interests as the inspiration.
What I ended up with was a fantasy world, far far away in a Galaxy no one has ever heard from...BLACK STAR...

Feel free to reach out to me if you like the game and concept or if you have any ideas on what I can improve.
